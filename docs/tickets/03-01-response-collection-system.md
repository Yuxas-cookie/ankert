# Ticket 03-01: Survey Response Collection System

## Overview
Implement the core system for collecting and managing survey responses, including response validation, storage, and real-time updates. This system handles the backend infrastructure for response collection and provides APIs for frontend integration.

## Goals

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Ticket 02-01: Survey Creation API (for survey structure)
- Ticket 02-02: Survey Question Types (for validation rules)

### External Dependencies
- Supabase PostgreSQL for data storage
- Supabase Real-time for live updates
- Redis (optional) for queue management
- Node.js crypto module for encryption

### Database Requirements
```sql
-- Response table structure
CREATE TABLE responses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  survey_id UUID REFERENCES surveys(id),
  respondent_id UUID,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'draft',
  started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Answer table structure
CREATE TABLE answers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  response_id UUID REFERENCES responses(id),
  question_id UUID,
  answer_data JSONB,
  answer_text TEXT,
  answer_number NUMERIC,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Response Data Structure
```typescript
interface SurveyResponse {
  id: string;
  surveyId: string;
  respondentId?: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'submitted' | 'validated' | 'archived';
  answers: Answer[];
  metadata: {
    ipAddress?: string;
    userAgent?: string;
    startTime: Date;
    submitTime?: Date;
    duration?: number;
  };
}

interface Answer {
  questionId: string;
  value: any;
  type: QuestionType;
  metadata?: {
    timeSpent?: number;
    changeCount?: number;
  };
}
```

### API Response Format
```typescript
interface ResponseSubmissionResult {
  success: boolean;
  responseId?: string;
  errors?: ValidationError[];
  warnings?: ValidationWarning[];
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement response caching for read-heavy operations
- Use database transactions for consistency
- Batch insert operations when possible
- Implement proper pagination for large datasets

### Security Measures
- Input sanitization for all response data
- Rate limiting per IP and survey
- CSRF protection for web submissions
- Audit logging for all response operations
- Regular security scans of stored data

- Session timeouts
- Browser compatibility issues

### Server-Side Errors
- Database connection failures
- Validation processing errors
- Storage capacity issues
- Rate limiting violations

## Monitoring and Logging

### Key Metrics
- Response submission rate
- Validation failure rate
- Processing time distribution
- Error rate by type
- Storage utilization

### Alerting Thresholds
