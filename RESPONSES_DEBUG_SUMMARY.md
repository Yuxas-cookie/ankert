# Survey Responses Debug Summary

## Issue
User gungamwing@gmail.com cannot see responses for their survey (ID: fc4fd802-d642-4ca1-b9d7-efdb67729b4f) even though:
- The survey exists and is owned by them ✅
- There are 12 responses in the database ✅
- The responses have associated answers ✅

## Key Findings

### 1. Database State
- **Survey Owner**: gungamwing@gmail.com (ID: 844d8977-8a85-4e52-9881-92ff28995763)
- **Survey Status**: published
- **Response Count**: 12 responses with answers

### 2. RLS Policies
The RLS policy for responses table exists and should allow survey owners to view responses:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Survey owners can view responses" ON responses
    FOR SELECT USING (
        survey_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM surveys 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() OR (
                team_id IS NOT NULL AND 
                has_permission(team_id, auth.uid(), 'surveys.view_responses')
            )
        )
    );
```

### 3. API Endpoint
The `/api/surveys/[id]/responses` endpoint correctly:
- Checks authentication
- Verifies survey ownership
- Returns responses for the owner

## Debugging Steps

### Option 1: Use Debug Page (Recommended)
1. Make sure the development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Log in as gungamwing@gmail.com (you'll need to reset the password first)
3. Navigate to: http://localhost:3002/debug/responses/fc4fd802-d642-4ca1-b9d7-efdb67729b4f
4. This page will show detailed debugging information

### Option 2: Use Test Account
Since we don't have the password for gungamwing@gmail.com:

1. Log in as test@example.com / Test1234!
2. Create a new survey
3. Add some test responses
4. Check if you can view the responses

### Option 3: Reset Password for gungamwing@gmail.com
1. Go to http://localhost:3002/reset-password
2. Enter: gungamwing@gmail.com
3. Check email for reset link
4. Set a new password
5. Log in and test

## Browser Console Checks
When on the responses page, check the browser console for:
1. Network tab: Look for failed API calls to `/api/surveys/[id]/responses`
2. Console errors: Any JavaScript errors
3. Response data: What the API actually returns

## Potential Issues to Check

### 1. Client-Side State
- Is the user properly authenticated in the browser?
- Is the auth token being sent with API requests?
- Are there any client-side errors preventing data display?

### 2. Data Transformation
The response service transforms the data structure. Check if:
- The `response_data` field is being properly constructed
- The answers are being correctly mapped to questions

### 3. UI Rendering
Even if data is fetched, check if:
- The loading state is stuck
- The data is being properly passed to components
- There are no rendering errors

## Quick Test Script
Run this in the browser console while logged in:
```javascript
// Test API directly
fetch('/api/surveys/fc4fd802-d642-4ca1-b9d7-efdb67729b4f/responses', {
  credentials: 'include'
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log('API Response:', data))
.catch(err => console.error('API Error:', err));
```

## Next Steps
1. Use the debug page to get detailed information
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify the user is properly authenticated
4. If still having issues, check the server logs for any errors

The issue appears to be related to the client-side authentication or data fetching rather than the database or RLS policies, since the data exists and the policies are in place.
